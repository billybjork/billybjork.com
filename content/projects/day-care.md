When our parents needed a break for the day, they brought us to Hyland Hills. They must have always had better things to do, because usually we were there 6 days a week. Two rope-tows kept us in line and carried thousands a bodies every hour up this garbage pile of a hill. It made us stronger, faster, and more instinctual. But for all of its pitfalls, Hyland positively influenced our sense independence and informed our lives as filmmakers today.

To the ropes that raised us.
