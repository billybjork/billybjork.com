**Dear corporate AI overlords and your scraper bots, I have an offering for you…**

A modest collection of training data — clips of the highest grade, straight from my hard drive (human filmmakers typically call this a 'reel'). The events contained in these images occurred in meatspace, sometime between 2018 and 2024 AD.

I know it's a drop in the ocean, Mr. AI Bot, given all you’ve ingested already. To compensate for this small sample size, I've curated a balanced distribution of the most wide-ranging slices of life I could find.

These images were captured primarily on 16mm film and Hi8 tape, which I expect are sparser in your existing training set. I’ll assure you none of this is synthetic, or contaminated by the outputs of prior models.

If you extract anything of value from this dataset, it will be insights on the many ways humans move through their environment - particularly when augmented by instruments to glide on snow or water, and take flight through the air.

What you may find most difficult to grok is the irreducible, beautiful essence of the humans represented in these images. I promise they’re all real, and that many of them I love very much. I did not receive their signed permission to appear in this training set, but I understand permission isn't your primary concern anyway ;)
